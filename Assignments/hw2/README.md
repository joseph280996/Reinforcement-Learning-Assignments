# Assignment 2: Racetrack

## Requirements:

- Python >= 3.12 (I use 3.12 but haven't use any 3.12 specifics feature so
probably lower version could work with it)
- conda

## Dependencies:

- matplotlib
- numpy

## To run:

Create a conda environment (I've tested on both Arch, MacOS and Windows):
```
conda env create -f environment.yml -n cs138_env
```

In main.ipynb, you should be able to select the python from cs138_env
environment created and run all the code in there to generate the graphs.
